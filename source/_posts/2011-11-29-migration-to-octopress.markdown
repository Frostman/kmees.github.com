I am currently migrating my blog from *Wordpress* to *Octopress*. The main
reason for the migration is the awful (at least for coding blogs) post editor in
Wordpress. With the migration I can write the posts in Markdown and Vim which,
hopefully, leads to more posts !

And because Octopress is new and shiny and geeky !
