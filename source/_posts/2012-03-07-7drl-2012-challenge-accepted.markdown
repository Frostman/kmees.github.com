From March 10th to March 18th, this years [Seven Day Roguelike Challenge](http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php/Seven_Day_Roguelike_Challenge) takes place. The goal of the challenge is to create a roguelike game in, well, seven days. I actually tried to participate in last years challenge, but due to a car accident about a week before the challenge, I wasn't really able to focus on it. Hopefully, this years challenge runs smoothly for me such that I can get a game finished.

I will try to blog about my progress on each of the seven days if I can manage to find some spare
time. I'm also thinking about streaming/recording the development process but I don't know if I can
get everything set up in time. In any case, the project will of course be hosted on github !
