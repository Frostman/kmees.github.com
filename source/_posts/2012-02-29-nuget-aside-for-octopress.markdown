I just finished as aside for [Octopress](http://www.octopress.org) that list the
Top N downloaded packages where you are an author. It also adds a link to your
NuGet gallery profile if you have one. The style is basically the same as the style of the github aside.

Since there is no official way to publish 3rd party add-ons for Octopress yet, I
created a [github repository](https://github.com/kmees/Octopress-NuGet-Aside) with the required files and setup instructions in the [ReadMe](https://github.com/kmees/Octopress-NuGet-Aside/blob/master/README.md).
