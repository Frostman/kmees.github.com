Inspired by the [DownmarkerWPF](https://github.com/Code52/DownmarkerWPF), I
decided to change the Style of the CMContrib WPF Demo to Metro. I used the same
Metro framework, namely [MahApps.Metro](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro) as DownmarkerWPF which is really cool. The only control that I wasn't able to 'metroize' was the _WebBrowser_ control which displays the code. Its scrollbars still have the old Windows look. Anyway, I'm quite happy with the result especially since this is my first Metro app. Any feedback is appreciated !
